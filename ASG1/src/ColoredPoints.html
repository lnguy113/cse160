    <h1>Explanation of AWESOME</h1>
    <p>For my awesome part of the assignment, I decided to create a new paint brush function. I created the diamond shape. Basically, I implemented two triangles to create the shape of a diamond. </p>

    <h1>Notes to Grader</h1>
    <p>I spent an unnecessary amount of time on this assignment because I had a super hard time trying to figure out how to get the override to work. I am working on mac so I was super confused because the Professor's example is on windows. But ultimately in the end, I was able to figure it out and I had a fun time completing this assignment.</p>

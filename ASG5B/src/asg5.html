    <h2> Notes to Grader </h2>
    <p> For this assingment, I had a lot of fun implementing my little world. 
        I used three different light source. I used directional light, point light, and ambient lighting.
        I used 24 blocks to create my chairs and table. 
        My idea of this world is to create a little cafe. 
        I also implemented a fog feature whenever you zoom out too far. </p>

    <h2>Sanrio Story</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my Sanrio Café! 
    Located the heart of a quaint Japanese-style café, nestled amidst the delicate petals of cherry blossoms, the soft murmur of laughter filled the air as characters settled at a table adorned with cherry blossom-themed decor. 
    The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the sweet scent of cherry blossoms, creating an ambiance of tranquility and warmth. 
    Characters come to share tales of their adventures and cherished memories over steaming cups of café, enveloped in the serenity of the cherry blossom-filled surroundings. </p>
    <p>As the server here, you have a special ability. By simply clicking the key "c", you can magically place a steaming cup of coffee for our dear customers to enjoy. Watch as their faces light up with delight at the sight of their favorite brew!</p>
    <p>But wait, what's this? Once our lovely customers have savored every last drop of their coffee, it's time for you to work your magic again. With a quick tap of the key "v", you can whisk away the empty cup, leaving the table clean and ready for the next round of delicious treats.</p>

    <h2>Wow Aspect</h2>
    <p>For my Wow Aspect of this project, I created the feature of adding and dropping coffee cups for the characters to enjoy. Along with this small mini game, I created some CSS work to my html files to make the webpage more appealing. I followed the general theme of Sanrio which is essentially shades of pink.</p>
    <p>I also added a feature of "Meet the Characters" for the users to learn a bit more about the characters!</p>

    <h2>Notes to Grader</h2>
    <p>During the duration of this assignment, I encountered a handful of issues. Some of these issues consist of the fps being to low and creating my game to lag, the adding and deleting function to be super difficult to cooporate with. For the previous portion of this assignment, we had to basically start by making the cubes. Considering the fact that every time I created a cube, I create a new Float and buffer, which made my game super laggy. To fix this problem, I tested out by adding global variables outside of my class function to allow the code to run faster and smoother.</p>
    <p>The hardest part of this assignment for me was to get my camera function to work. I followed along the professors helper videos to get started. I also added bounds to my code. The idea of my game was to create a cafe so I needed to stay in put. Something I also struggled with was the adding and deleting portion of the code. The blocks would tend to shift and move in different directions.</p>

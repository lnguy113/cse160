            <h2>Welcome to my Sanrio Sky Cafe >.<</h2>
            <p>
                Our Story: In the heart of the whimsical town of Kittyville, nestled high among the fluffy, pastel-colored clouds, was the magical Sky Café. This café was not like any other; it was owned by the beloved Sanrio characters, who all worked together to create a dreamy paradise for their friends and visitors.

                Perched on a floating island of fluffy clouds, the Sky Café is a cozy haven designed to bring joy to everyone who visits. The café itself is a quaint building with large windows that offer breathtaking views of the sky. The interior is decorated with pastel hues, twinkling fairy lights, and plush, comfy seating. Tables are adorned with fresh flowers, and the air is always filled with the sweet scent of baked goods and fresh coffee.

            <h2>Notes to Grader</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, I just added different obj files to complete my character collection. I also added a story line along with the "meet the characters" and "the menu" features. Throughout this assignment, I was mainly playing around with the html and the css work to make my assignment presentable. I also added a fog feature for when you scroll out futher away from the canvas.
